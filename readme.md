# Gamepad Compare Browser App

This web app intends to help adjusting the dead zone / response curve setting of controllers so that they match another controller.

## Usage

Copy the HTML file somewhere on your system, e.g. your Desktop or Documents folder. Open it in your browser.

Connect the two controllers you want to compare. Move the joysticks on the two controllers by the same amount and see the difference in the registered output (if any).

Change the deadzone / response curve of one of the controllers until the output matches the other controller more closely.

## Known issues

Sometimes the page will update slowly after connecting a new controller. Refresh the page to fix this.
